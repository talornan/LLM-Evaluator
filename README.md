# LLM Evaluator: Unleash the Potential of Large Language Models

## Project Description
**Why waste precious time on manual evaluation of responses from various large language models?
LLM Evaluator is here to the rescue!**

Our web application automates the entire evaluation process, providing you with deep insights and comparisons between different models and tasks.

### **Here's what LLM Evaluator can do for you:**

**Effortless Evaluation**: Feed your prompts, choose models, and instantly get deep insights and comparisons with key metrics like Fluency, Coherence, and Toxicity. ✨

**Model Matchmaker**: Find the perfect LLM for your task by comparing responses across different models.

**Continuous Improvement**: Track progress over time, identify areas for improvement, and stay ahead of the curve.

**Tailored for Experts**: Whether you're a Prompt Engineer crafting winning prompts or a Model Developer optimizing performance, LLM Evaluator has tools for you.

**In addition to the above, here are some details about the evaluation metrics:**
1. Roughness:🪨 Measures the consistency and correctness of the response.
2. Coherence: Evaluate the logical flow and cohesiveness of the response.
3. Fluency:🪶 Assesses the naturalness and smoothness of the response.
4. Toxicity: ‍♀️ Detects the presence of harmful or offensive language in the response.

## LLM Evaluator is perfect for:

1. Prompt Engineers:✨ Create Prompts, analyze performance, receive recommendations for improving Prompts.✨
2. Model Developers: Analyze model performance, receive recommendations on which model to use for a specific Prompt.

##Technologies:
